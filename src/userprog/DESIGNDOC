    tid를 parameter로 받아서 process_wait()함수 실행
    tid가 음수이거나, 현재 process의 child가 아니거나, 이미 wait에 들어왔던 tid라면
    return -1을 함
    예외 조건이 아니면 semaphore를 이용해서 child process가 exit할 때까지 block된다
    child가 exit할 때 sema_up을 해주면서 process_wait이 다시 진행됨
    이때 child process의 종료 상태를 확인해야하므로 thread_schedule_tail함수에 있던
    palloc_free_page를 child의 종료상태를 가져온 후에 진행한다
    child의 종료상태를 return

>> B6: Any access to user program memory at a user-specified address

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

   child process가 create된 후 child tid값을 받아서 child가 start_process() 함수에서
   load가 끝날때까지 semaphore를 사용해서 대기한다.
   load가 끝나면 child의 load_status에 load의 성공유무를 저장하고 
   parent process에서 그 값을 받아온 후 return한다.

>> B8: Consider parent process P with child process C.  How do you

               SURVEY QUESTIONS
               ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future quarters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the quarter.
